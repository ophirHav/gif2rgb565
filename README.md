# gif2rgb565
arduino sample code for non blocking gif animation on tft screen.<br />
arduino code was tested on esp32 and arduino uno.

I have changed the python script from PNG-to-RGB565 project (https://github.com/jimmywong2003/PNG-to-RGB565), to support animated GIF files, and an optional output of header, object files or both.
